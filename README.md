# armybuilder this project is a fictional app that demonstrates my skill with objects that are listed below;
  3 tier Architecture (User layer, Business layer, Data layer),
  Object-bound controls
  View/extract data from a database(using SQL commands)
  Multifroms with shared data
  List<>
  Try/Catch
  
What this App allows users to do is browser through the collection of recuites adds them to a list<>. After selection, users 
can view all recuites added by clicking on view army button. Here all recuites in list<> are displayed in the listbox and
some calulations of price and health are totaled to show my ablity to calculate the data in the list<>. The button fucntions
should be self explaintory of its use. If the user wanted to add another recuite not in the database the user may do so. When
reaching in the database SQL commands where used.
